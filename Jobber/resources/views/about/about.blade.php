                <p class="h3 text-center">Hi, thank you for using my website! It was created by Hristiyan Dimitrov, who is a student at VTU "St. Cyrill and st. Methodius". The main idea of this website is to fascilitate people when looking for their new job in IT! I know how tedious it can be in the begining so I decided to create Jobber - the one place where your criteria is applied to your company instead the other way around! </p>
